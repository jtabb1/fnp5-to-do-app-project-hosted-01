RVM used your Gemfile for selecting Ruby, it is all fine - Heroku does that too,
you can ignore these warnings with 'rvm rvmrc warning ignore /Users/jeremiahtabb/Development/Code/ReactProjects/fnp5-to-do-app-project-hosted-01/Gemfile'.
To ignore the warning for all files run 'rvm rvmrc warning ignore allGemfiles'.
